Odd/Eve is a digital adaptation of the classic cricket game we used to play in our childhood. 
This Python-based game is designed for a single player, where you play against the computer. 
In each turn, you choose a number between 1 to 6. If your number matches the computer's number, it's a wicket. 
If the numbers are different, your score increases by the number you chose. Odd/Eve brings the simplicity and fun of the traditional game to your computer.
